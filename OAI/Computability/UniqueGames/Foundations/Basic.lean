Finite prerequisites for Holenstein's consistent sampling argument (Lemma 5.2).

`firstAccepted` is an actual bounded rejection sampler on a shared finite list
of proposals. `first_union_common` proves its synchronization property.
The remaining theorems establish the exact overlap/union mass formulas and the
agreement lower bound used to analyze a first accepted shared proposal.

No infinite random process or locally computable embedding is asserted here.
